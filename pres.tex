\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Historical productivity}
\frame
{
  \frametitle{Cocci is very productive}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> This is pretty obvious to most of us.
  \item<2-> How does he do it?
  \item<3-> No one really knows.
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Motivation of empirical study}
\frame
{
  \frametitle{Motivation of empirical study}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Collect data to document productivity for future generations of RAs.
  \item<2-> Conduct inference on causes (and \textit{effects}) of productivity.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<3-> Cocci is a big fan of the podcast Serial.
    \item<4-> Presumably, his productivity decreased on days in which he was listening to a new Serial episode.
    \item<5-> If we could analyze his productivity over time, we could determine on which days new episodes of Serial were released.
    \end{itemize}
  \item<6-> Embarrass him in front of all his loved ones.

  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Description of data}
\frame
{
  \frametitle{Description of data}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Cocci uses the \texttt{tmux} utility on the RAN to manage large collections of "panes", or pseudo terminal sessions.
  \item<2-> Make observations of the number of panes that Cocci has open at a given point to get a sense of productivity over time.
  \item<3-> I collect a novel dataset of hourly observations of the number of panes open:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<4-> Timestamped at 9am through 5pm, seven days a week.
    \item<5-> Data collected from August 11, 2014 to yesterday (July 21, 2015).
    \item<6-> 3100 hourly observations over 345 days in total.
    \item<7-> Don't even worry about how I did this.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

      \item Hours excluded from sample are non-workdays or days on which the RAN was reset.

  \item Days excluded from sample are non-workdays or days on which the RAN was reset. \texttt{has\_episode\_today} is marked if an episode of Serial was released on that day.

\section{Model}
\frame
{
\frametitle{Model: Description}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Use absolute change in panes as a rough proxy for hourly productivity, and aggregated absolute hourly change in panes as a rougher proxy for daily productivity.
\item<2-> Include squared term to capture all of the super duper non-linear effects we expect.
\item<3-> Control for day of the week as well as Brent Crude spot prices.
\item<3-> Train a boosted decision trees classifier, because why not, and because Cocci deserves only the best.
\item<4-> Train on data from August 11, 2014 to March 31, 2015; test on data from April 1 to yesterday.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\frame
{
\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Based on Cocci's productivity trends, an episode of Serial was released with 90\% certainty on May 12. It's just that no one but him has noticed yet.
\item<2-> Good luck at Princeton!
\item<3-> Do Something Good Everyday!
\end{itemize}
